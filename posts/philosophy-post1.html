Being Truthful

Only lie to avert genuine evil.

When I try to summarize why people in modern society should avoid lying, five reasons stand out: Energy, Cognitive Impairment, Reputation, Societal Effects, and Misinformation.

Energy. A lie demands more effort than the truth because you must keep a fictitious narrative consistent in your mind. Over time that overhead drains motivation and stalls progress on other tasks.

Cognitive Impairment. The more often you deceive, the harder it becomes to separate fact from fiction in your own memory, and the less accurately you recall details.

Reputation. To be branded a liar is damaging in any social group. Conversely, those known for strict honesty gain status and trust.

Societal Effects. Societies function only when members can reliably share truth. As deception spreads, efficiency falls—resources are wasted on verification and damage control—and eventually the social fabric frays as people retreat into smaller, trusted circles.

Misinformation. I hold one principle absolutely: falsehood is the root of every evil decision. Every harmful act traces back to an incorrect belief. Spreading lies therefore raises the probability that others will choose wrongly.

What, then, are the benefits of lying?

I am not so dogmatic as to claim that deception is always unjustified. In an ideal world no one would lie, but in reality certain exceptions exist. Here are the candidate benefits (which I call Rebuttals):

Rebuttal 1: Lying to protect yourself or others from genuine, overwhelming evil.

Rebuttal 2: Lying to practice succeeding at Rebuttal 1.

Rebuttal 3: Lying to enhance your reputation.

Rebuttal 4: Lying to train yourself and society to detect deception and discover truth.

Rebuttal 5: Lying as mental exercise.

Of these five, I believe only the first is legitimate. The others are either unnecessary or unfounded.

Rebuttals 2 and 5 can be satisfied by playing deception‑based games, so actual lying is unnecessary. If you want those benefits, play such games regularly.

Rebuttal 4 fails for the same reason widespread disease is not justified by the value of an immune response. Society’s effort to spot lies scales with the threat liars pose; your personal decision to deceive adds little except extra cost. Claiming that someone else would lie anyway does not absolve you of responsibility.

Finally, reputation. If you accept any notion of a greater good, lying for personal status (outside Rebuttal 1) conflicts with that good. If you reject moral absolutes, the question reduces to whether lying will, in fact, boost your standing. In practice it is usually easier—and more reliable—to earn respect by consistent honesty. A reputation for truthfulness can be remarkably powerful, even if some people dispute that claim.

Since I like to add a little bit of math in most of my post, the following is a mathematical toy model for calculating when it is optimal to tell lies. (It was written in LaTeX, so sorry if the format change is weird)

The Mathematical Model for Telling Lies that follows is offered mainly to illustrate how complicated such calculations quickly become. You can keep adding features, tuning matrices, or swapping in non‑linear networks, yet every refinement brings new assumptions, data requirements, and failure modes. The exercise is instructive—it shows just how many variables must align before a lie can be rationally defended—but it also reinforces the virtue of simplicity. In practice it may be wiser, and certainly less error‑prone, to adopt a straightforward rule like the one stated above: lie only to avert genuine evil, and tell the truth in all other cases.
