<p>
Being Truthful
</p>


<p>
Only lie to avert genuine evil.
</p>

<p>
When I try to summarize why people in modern society should avoid lying, five reasons stand<br>
out: Energy, Cognitive Impairment, Reputation, Societal Effects, and Misinformation.
</p>

<p>
Energy. A lie demands more effort than the truth because you must keep a fictitious narrative<br>
consistent in your mind. Over time that overhead drains motivation and stalls progress on other<br>
tasks.
</p>

<p>
Cognitive Impairment. The more often you deceive, the harder it becomes to separate fact<br>
from fiction in your own memory, and the less accurately you recall details.
</p>

<p>
Reputation. To be branded a liar is damaging in any social group. Conversely, those known for<br>
strict honesty gain status and trust.
</p>

<p>
Societal Effects. Societies function only when members can reliably share truth. As deception<br>
spreads, efficiency falls—resources are wasted on verification and damage control—and<br>
eventually the social fabric frays as people retreat into smaller, trusted circles.
</p>

<p>
Misinformation. I hold one principle absolutely: falsehood is the root of every evil decision.<br>
Every harmful act traces back to an incorrect belief. Spreading lies therefore raises the<br>
probability that others will choose wrongly.
</p>

<p>
What, then, are the benefits of lying?
</p>

<p>
I am not so dogmatic as to claim that deception is always unjustified. In an ideal world no one<br>
would lie, but in reality certain exceptions exist. Here are the candidate benefits (which I call<br>
Rebuttals):
</p>

<p>
Rebuttal 1: Lying to protect yourself or others from genuine, overwhelming evil.
</p>

<p>
Rebuttal 2: Lying to practice succeeding at Rebuttal 1.
</p>

<p>
Rebuttal 3: Lying to enhance your reputation.
</p>

<p>
Rebuttal 4: Lying to train yourself and society to detect deception and discover truth.
</p>

<p>
Rebuttal 5: Lying as mental exercise.
</p>

<p>
Of these five, I believe only the first is legitimate. The others are either unnecessary or<br>
unfounded.
</p>

<p>
Rebuttals 2 and 5 can be satisfied by playing deception‑based games, so actual lying is<br>
unnecessary. If you want those benefits, play such games regularly.
</p>

<p>
Rebuttal 4 fails for the same reason widespread disease is not justified by the value of an<br>
immune response. Society’s effort to spot lies scales with the threat liars pose; your personal<br>
decision to deceive adds little except extra cost. Claiming that someone else would lie anyway<br>
does not absolve you of responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Finally, reputation. If you accept any notion of a greater good, lying for personal status (outside<br>
Rebuttal 1) conflicts with that good. If you reject moral absolutes, the question reduces to<br>
whether lying will, in fact, boost your standing. In practice it is usually easier—and more<br>
reliable—to earn respect by consistent honesty. A reputation for truthfulness can be remarkably<br>
powerful, even if some people dispute that claim.
</p>

<p>
Since I like to add a little bit of math in most of my post, The Following is a mathematical Toy<br>
Model for calculating when it is optimal to tell lies. (It was written in Latex, so sorry if the formate<br>
change is weird)
</p>

<p>
The Mathematical  Model For Telling Lies that follows is offered mainly to illustrate how<br>
complicated such calculations quickly become. You can keep adding features, tuning matrices,<br>
or swapping in non‑linear networks, yet every refinement brings new assumptions, data<br>
requirements, and failure modes. The exercise is instructive—it shows just how many variables<br>
must align before a lie can be rationally defended—but it also reinforces the virtue of simplicity.<br>
In practice it may be wiser, and certainly less error‑prone, to adopt a straightforward rule like the<br>
one stated above: lie only to avert genuine evil, and tell the truth in all other cases.
