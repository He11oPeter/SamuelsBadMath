<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The movie "idiocracy", a comedy from 2006, presents a picture of a future in which humans have evolved to become comedicly stupid. The premise looks something like this: society has gotten to the point where the educated are deciding to not have children and the stupid are reproducing more, thus through heredity each generation becomes on average less intelligent. Now I must say that this is just a comedy, and although it does possess a basic understanding of heredity, it fails to acknowledge that general "smartness" is more determined in our current society by education and upbringing than it is by genetics. I don't blame the movie for this misconception, for it is just a comedy, but the misconception made in the movie is the same misconception made by early 20th-century Eugenists who promoted castrating "imbeciles". This flawed fear was also later used as fuel for Nazi idealogy against those deemed inferior...</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I do however think that the movie can tell you something valuable. Without selective pressure [a natural or unnatural force that designates which genetics are passed on], future generations will not be better genetically prepared for future challenges. Without selective pressure, there will be no beneficial evolution. There can still be diversity. Diversity is caused by random mutations causing unique phenotypes, however, there will be no net direction in which the population moves. In this society, even uniquely successful phenotypes are destined to be homogenized due to the lack of any selective advantage. This homogenization I think would make it difficult for any beneficial genes to flourish and instead turn all of humanity into a one-genome one-mind society.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, there is the question of whether these concerns actually apply to our current society. I believe is does. Almost everyone in developed countries is living until reproductive age. It seems that more and more, the people that have less children do so because they are focusing on other productive matters. It is also true that higher education and income level individuals are having fewer children than those of lower income and education level. But the question still remains, does this mean that there is not a selective advantage for genes that promote evolutionary progress?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I should specify what I mean by the term evolutionary progress. In the simplest sense, it refers to the changes to genes that promote the survival of those genes. In the more complicated sense, such as human society, it also includes innovations, ideas, and prosperity that can be passed onto future generations leading to greater survival and growth.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, in our current society is there still a selective advantage for genes that promote evolutionary progress? I would say no. I think we have become too homogenized, survival and reproduction are no longer difficult, and basic reproduction no longer seems capable of bringing us to the next stage of biological evolution. However, unlike the movements of the early 20th century that focused on eliminating the supposed inferior inorder to make the remainder more perfect, the next stage of biological evolution is not about perfecting humans. Humans are already the result of billions of years of craftsmanship so there isn't much to be perfected. Trying to make people "perfect" will just homogenize people even more than we have already done. Nor do I think that the greatest benefits of the next stage of evolution lie in getting rid of every inconvenience to the body or in immortality. The next stage is about tweaking human biology in specific ways in order to prepare people to handle challenges that previously were difficult or impossible to accomplish.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now I will step back a bit and give a more structured argument for my reasoning. The following topics will be covered:</span></p>

<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Arial; color: #151516; -webkit-text-stroke: #151516"><span class="s1"><b>1) Why we should care about the continued evolutionary progress of humans</b><b></b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I think in order to understand what our objectives are we need to understand where our purpose is derived from. The purpose of our actions is derived from the forces that create and govern us (both internal and external governing forces). This is just a simple recognition of cause and effect. In order for us to have a purpose, that purpose must have a cause. These causes are called the forces/things/laws of nature that create and govern us. I think those who understand and agree with the principles of evolution, understand that these very same principles are the forces that create us and thus are the forces from which our objectives are derived. Thus our objectives and purpose are rooted in the necessity to pursue evolutionary success.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you do not believe me yet simply think of the two clear consequences to not achieving evolutionary success. The first is that you and your lineage will cease to exist. Organisms that do not achieve evolutionary success by definition die off. The second consequence, and the one that is more direct, is that we are generally programmed to feel negative emotions toward events that are evolutionarily bad for us and positive emotions for that which are evolutionarily good. I say generally, as it is always possible to find exceptions. Exceptions do not disprove the direct link between evolutionary theory and positive emotion, it only proves that evolution hasn't made us perfect and that there are always adjustments and progress to be made.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some might object to this idea and say that people make correct decisions all the time that don't result in happiness for themselves. I would agree with this objection, but these actions are still either made based on the belief that a greater amount of happiness will come in the future to themselves or members or their group. And so they are still following the objective for happiness/positive emotion. Aristotle said that happiness is the ultimate good as it is the one thing that you need not explain to someone why they would want it. (once again 'Happiness' is used interchangably with the 'positive emotions') I think that Aristotle was on the right track when he said this, but what he is missing is the fact that the purpose of happiness is to act as a guide toward that which is evolutionarily good for us. Thus happiness and evolutionary success go hand in hand. Emotions are both a guide and a reward on the path to evolutionary success.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">However, to stop the analysis here is to mistake an instrumental goal for the final one. While Aristotle identified happiness as a chief good, his deeper insight was that true human flourishing (<i>eudaimonia</i>) comes from fulfilling our unique function (<i>ergon</i>). Other animals know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>that</i> things are so, but humans are uniquely capable of understanding <i>why</i> they are so. Our most fundamental characteristic is the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake (</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>sophia</i>, or theoretical wisdom). Evolutionary success and the happiness that guides it are the bootstrap mechanisms—the processes that built a biological machine capable of a higher purpose. That higher purpose, which supersedes all others, is the attainment of Knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Arial; color: #151516; -webkit-text-stroke: #151516"><span class="s1"><b>1.b)</b><b></b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I think it would be good to lay out the above argument in a different format. This restatement will be more exhaustive and can be skipped, but I hope it can give further insight into the origins of my beliefs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Definition 0: God/the infinite/the self-created thing:</b> This is the thing that encompasses all of existence and for which nothing exists outside of it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Axiom 1: There Are No Purpose Monopoles:</b> All things only possess purpose if there is something else external to that thing for which it can have purpose in relation to.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Axiom 2: The purpose of a thing is determined by the things that create and govern it.</b> This is a simple recognition of cause and effect. For us to have a purpose, purpose must have come from all of the things responsible for creating that purpose and those are identical to the things that created us.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Axiom 3: All things are created either from themselves or from external things.</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Axiom 4: Fundamental Purpose:</b> The fundamental purpose is the necessary base or core purpose of a thing. From axiom 2 we can see that the most fundamental purpose would come from the most fundamental cause of a thing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Axiom 5: The Thing Created from Itself:</b> For a thing to be created from itself, its essence must necessitate its existence. It is the uncaused cause. It is God.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Proposition 1: Humans are not self-created things.</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Proposition 2: Humans are created by external things.</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Proposition 3: The purpose of a human is determined by forces external to ourselves.</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Proposition 4: God (the infinite/the self-created thing) has no purpose.</b> I establish proposition 4 only to dissuade those who think that the purpose of a human is somehow aligned with the purpose of God or the universe.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From proposition 3 we established that humans are determined by the forces that created us and govern us. So what is the purpose of human decision-making?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Revised Proposition 5: The most fundamental purpose of human decision-making is the attainment of Knowledge (the "Fundamental Good").</b> While evolution is a primary force that <i>created</i> the biological human, the capacity for abstract reason, scientific inquiry, and the accumulation of knowledge represents the most fundamental and unique characteristic of the human mind. Epistemology, the study of knowledge itself, is concerned with the mind's relation to reality. The pursuit of a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of that reality—moving from mere true belief to justified knowledge—is the highest activity of which our minds are capable. This is our ultimate purpose, the "Fundamental Good" that all other goals should serve.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>New Proposition 6: Evolutionary progress is the primary </b><b><i>instrumental</i></b><b> purpose of human action.</b> It is the process by which the biological and social substrates necessary for the preservation and expansion of Knowledge are developed, secured, and enhanced. Evolution gave us the brains to begin this quest. Consciously guided evolution, through technologies like gene editing, is the means by which we can improve the hardware for this quest. It is the project of forging a better vessel for the pursuit of understanding.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Therefore, we must care about evolutionary progress not as our ultimate destination, but as the essential and ongoing journey that serves the ultimate good of Knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Arial; color: #151516; -webkit-text-stroke: #151516"><span class="s1"><b>2) Why we should care about the continued progress via biological evolution</b><b></b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What does it mean to pursue evolutionary progress? To pursue the continued survival, growth, and prosperity of your state of being. For a society then it is the shared state of being.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thought experiment: Let's say you were to have a child. In this world you have the option to modify your child's DNA in any manner and doctors, engineers, scientists, and philosophers will consult you on the manner of changes that you should make. These changes are made under the pursuit of evolutionary progress. However based on the definition that I have given above it seems that each change you make would diminish the similarity between yourself and your child and thus your state of being is lessened in the child. It seems that in the pursuit of evolutionary progress then it is necessary to make changes to you and your lineages and that these changes when compounded would make future generations unrecongnizable to the current generation. Thus I think it is necessary to change the definition of Evolutionary progress to the survival, growth, and beneficial complexity of your lineage or group lineage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I think evolutionary progression including the principle of change makes sense. The reason for mate selection is to find a mate that will cause your offspring to be hopefully more evolutionarily successful than the parents. And in a more general sense, change is unavoidable. Each moment we are changing to become a new. We should continue to pursue evolutionary progression because of the simple recognition that evolution uses all of the tools at its disposal and so to deny ourselves of a tool is to make ourselves worse. I am not saying that we shouldn't use discernment. I am not saying that we should not exercise caution. I am saying that with the advent of modern gene editing technology, we now have the ability to create changes that can accelerate our ability to survive, grow, and create useful complexity. The question is not whether we should make changes, but what changes we should make.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Framed by our ultimate purpose, the pursuit of gene editing becomes a tool for <i>epistemic enhancement</i>. The goal is to refine and augment the biological "hardware" upon which all knowledge acquisition depends. This is not about the crude pursuit of "perfection," but about the strategic diversification and enhancement of our cognitive capacities. Potential avenues for such enhancement include:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Sensory Augmentation:</b> Modifying our biology to perceive phenomena beyond our current sensory range, such as different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum or magnetic fields, opening up entirely new domains of empirical data.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Cognitive Enhancement:</b> Increasing the brain's neuroplasticity, memory consolidation, and pattern-recognition capabilities to accelerate learning and allow for the comprehension of more complex systems.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Psychological Resilience:</b> Altering our neurochemistry to be more resilient to cognitive biases, tribalism, and irrational fear, making us more reliable pursuers of knowledge.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Arial; color: #151516; -webkit-text-stroke: #151516"><span class="s1"><b>3) Why human Biological evolution has stagnated</b><b></b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As I stated in the beginning I believe that human biological evolution has stagnated (or at the very least it has stagnated in comparison to the rapid technological progression of the last few centuries). The logic I present is fairly simple (perhaps to simple). There needs to be two things for the evolution of a population: (1) new diversity and (2) selective pressure. As human society has become more interconnected we have prioritized the survival of all of its members. Combining this with the fact that those who are considered successful (higher education, higher income, longer life span, etc) seem to be reproducing at a lower rate, it is very hard to see how this pattern could lead to any sort of positive biological evolution.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">one rebuttal to this argument might be to say that the very fact that these people aren't reproducing proves that they aren't evolutionarily successful. For if they were then they would be reproducing. However, this argument forgets the distinction between evolutionary success in regard to the progression of society and evolutionary success in terms of producing viable offspring. It is very much possible to be evolutionary successful without producing direct offspring. As a society, we seem to have unconsciously agreed on this fact, which is why so many intentionally produce less offspring.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In summary, I think evolutionarily positive selective pressure for society has stopped as metrics of success for society are not correlated with the ability to produce offspring. Additionally, the rate of technological progression has advanced at such a quick pace in the last few centuries that the opportunities to change our own human forms to match the capaciites and diversity of our technology is great. This divergence has created a critical and ever-widening "wisdom gap," where our technological power outstrips the cognitive and ethical capacity of our Stone Age minds to manage it wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Arial; color: #151516; -webkit-text-stroke: #151516"><span class="s1"><b>4) The Challenges of Pursuing Gene Editing as a Mechanism of Evolutionary Progress</b><b></b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Here are just a few of the large issues that I think we should think about when talking about the future of Biological evolution.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Alienation:</b> Changing our biology for the better means that we ultimately would change the manner in which human brains think. This may lead to a sense of alienation amongst members of society who have been modified in unique ways. This may cause communication between members to be difficult.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>The Meaning of "Human":</b> In the pursuit of evolutionary progression, what does it mean to be human? There will be many issues that come from the fracturing of humans into many species.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Respect for Past Biology:</b> It is difficult to predict what changes are necessary when we have such a poor view of the future. To this i say that every person who has ever wanted to change themselves, and has managed to do it, has caused a transformation of themselves that they had no way of understanding the full consequences.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Directing Evolution:</b> Is it even possible to provide positive direction to our evolution, when evolution is generally a thing governed by random statistical processes? Absolutely we can, all thinking creatures have the capability to direct their life and lineage with greater exactitude than that of the most baser impulses that control most creatures. Evolution like any source of knowledge is something that can be used to our advantage the more that we understand it. </span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Maintaining Diversity and Preventing Monoculture:</b> The ability to change our biology may lead to too many people making the same types of changes, causing a lack of diversity.</span><span class="s4"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="s1"> If certain enhancements become highly desirable, market forces and social pressures could push toward a genetic monoculture, reducing overall genetic diversity and making our species more vulnerable to novel pathogens or other unforeseen environmental challenges.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Catastrophic Technical and Ethical Failures: </b>What is the potential of creating humans that have catastrophic effects on society as a whole? This concern goes beyond simple technical errors and touches on the unpredictable nature of enhancing complex traits. For instance, the very enhancements that could lead to unprecedented scientific discovery and creativity could also produce an individual with extraordinary intelligence, charisma, and ambition, but who is also manipulative, sociopathic, and bent on goals that are destructive to society. The potential emergence of individuals who are vastly more capable than the average person in negative ways presents a profound and difficult-to-predict risk. A mistake in enhancement is not just a health problem for one person; it could be a catastrophe for civilization, passed down through all subsequent generations.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Discrimination and a Heritable Genetic Divide:</b> In a world where people have been modified to be more or less capable in certain respects, how should discrimination be handled?  If we live in a world where the minds and bodies of individuals have been modified for specific purposes, do we have the right to discriminate based on these modifications? A primary societal risk is that access to expensive enhancement technologies will be limited to the wealthy, allowing them to purchase genetic advantages for their children. This could entrench existing inequalities and create a permanent, biological class system—a "genetic aristocracy". This problem is compounded by the fact that most genomic data comes from individuals of European ancestry, meaning new therapies may be less effective for minority populations, further widening health and social disparities.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>The Geopolitical Threat of a Genetic Arms Race:</b> Gene-editing technology is a quintessential dual-use technology, with U.S. intelligence classifying it as a potential Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD). Unlike nuclear weapons, which are governed by the logic of mutually assured destruction, genetic weapons could be subtle, targeted, and deniable. This could include stealth viruses with long latency periods or "ethnic weapons" designed to target individuals with specific genetic markers. The relatively low cost and accessibility of CRISPR lowers the barrier to entry for rogue states and non-state actors, potentially triggering a new and highly destabilizing global arms race.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Mitigating Risk with Reversible Technologies:</b> A significant technical and ethical challenge of gene editing is its permanence. However, emerging technologies offer a potential solution. Epigenetic editing systems, such as CRISPRoff, do not alter the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, they add reversible chemical tags that turn genes "on" or "off". This creates a biological "off-switch," offering a vital safety mechanism that could dramatically lower the stakes of intervention by allowing changes to be undone if they produce unintended consequences.</span></li>

<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Arial; color: #151516; -webkit-text-stroke: #151516"><span class="s1"><b>5) Suggested Guidelines For the Future of Gene Editing</b><b></b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The original text suggests a framework based on freedom of choice and medical privacy, where parents, in consultation with physicians, make decisions about genetic changes for their offspring with minimal government intervention. While this principle of individual liberty is paramount, the scale of the challenges discussed—from the risk of a genetic caste system to a global arms race—highlights the potential for rational individual choices to lead to collectively disastrous outcomes. A robust framework must therefore create an ecosystem that supports responsible and equitable choices, rather than simply leaving individuals to navigate this complex landscape alone. The following guidelines expand upon the initial proposal to create such a system.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>A Polycentric Governance Model:</b> Rather than relying on a single top-down government authority, which is often inefficient and politically unworkable, a more resilient approach is a "polycentric" or "ecosystem" model. This involves a network of overlapping governance bodies, including national regulatory agencies, international conventions on human rights and bioweapons, and self-regulation by scientific and professional organizations that set standards for research and publication. This creates a web of checks and balances that can adapt to a rapidly changing field.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>The Mandate for Public Deliberation:</b> For a technology with such profound societal implications, the choices made by parents and doctors should be informed by a broad societal conversation. This requires a global commitment to "extensive and inclusive public participation" that goes beyond simply informing the public. Structured processes like citizens' juries and consensus conferences can create a genuine dialogue where public values can be articulated and integrated into the ethical frameworks that guide practitioners, ensuring the technology's trajectory reflects a broad consensus.</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>An International Framework for Security:</b> The clear danger of a genetic arms race necessitates a specific international security regime. This is not about limiting parental choice but about preventing the weaponization of the technology. This framework should include strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention with verification and inspection mechanisms, establishing global monitoring for weaponization programs, and creating norms of transparency for state-funded research to build confidence and prevent a spiral of suspicion.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s3"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Policies to Ensure Equitable Access:</b> To prevent a genetic class divide where "freedom of choice" is only a reality for the wealthy, proactive policies are needed to ensure equitable access to the technology's benefits. This could include significant public investment in therapies for genetic diseases, price regulations to ensure affordability, and major initiatives to diversify genomic databases so that therapies are effective for people of all ancestries. This approach ensures that the power to choose is not a privilege reserved for the few.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>A Regulatory Preference for Reversibility:</b> Governance can proactively steer innovation toward safer pathways. Regulatory bodies can create a "fast track" for the development and approval of reversible epigenetic editing technologies like CRISPRoff. By making the path to clinical use faster and cheaper for reversible methods compared to permanent germline alterations, the system would create a powerful incentive for industry to prioritize technologies that inherently mitigate the most profound ethical risks, empowering parents with safer, more controllable choices.</span></p>
